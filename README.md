# LDA, QDA, and RDA from Scratch

This project implements three classic classification algorithms from scratch in Python:
- **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)**
- **Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)**
- **Regularized Discriminant Analysis (RDA)**

The goal is to study how their decision boundaries adapt to datasets with different covariance structures.

## Project Structure

- `data/` — Scripts to generate synthetic datasets.
- `models/` — Implementation of the LDA, QDA, and RDA models.
- `plots/` — Functions for visualization and plotting decision boundaries.
- `experiments/` — Experiments and model comparisons.
- `utils/` — Utility functions (e.g., metrics, covariance computation).

## Setup

Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
